## 1. Core System Setup
These are the foundational elements that must be in place before other features can be added.

### 1.1 User Authentication
- Admin: Manage students, teachers, schedules, and payments.
- Teacher: View classes, manage students, and track performance.
- Student: View classes, check schedules, and access study materials.

### 1.2 Class Scheduling
- Allow admins/teachers to create and manage class schedules.
- Include notifications for class reminders.

### 1.3 Fee Management:
- Fee payment tracking for students.
- Generate receipts and manage payment history.

### 1.4 Performance Tracking:
- Allow teachers to track student attendance and grades.
- Provide students access to performance reports.

### Communication Tools:(Optional)
- Messaging system for students and teachers.
- Notifications for important updates.

### 2. Database Design
- Create models for `User`, `classes`, `subject`, `fees`, `attendance`, `notifications`, `study materials`.
- Set up necessary relationships between models 

### 3. Frontend and Backend


### 3.1 Frontend:
- Use React for a dynamic and responsive interface.
- Prioritize user experience with clear navigation and UI design.
### 3.2 Backend:
- Use Express.js to build RESTful APIs for data communication.
- Implement secure user authentication and authorization.

### 4. Authentication and Authorization
- Secure login/signup for students, teachers, and admins.
- Use JWT or sessions to manage user authentication.
- Role-based access control (e.g., students cannot access admin functionality)

### 5. Payment Integration
- Integrate a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) for fee payments.
- Track payment statuses and generate receipts.

### 6. Scalability and Performance (Later)
- Use caching (e.g., Redis) to improve performance for repeated requests.
- Plan for scalability, ensuring the app can handle a growing number of users.

### 7. Notifications and Alerts(Later)
- Add email or SMS notifications for fee reminders, class schedules, or announcements.
- Use libraries like Nodemailer or external services like Twilio.

### 8. Security
- Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., passwords, payment info).
- Validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
- Implement HTTPS for secure communication.

### 9. Testing
- Test for edge cases and usability:
- Unit testing: Test individual components and routes.
- Integration testing: Test API endpoints.
- Use tools like Jest, Postman, or Cypress.

### 10. Documentation
- Maintain proper documentation for:
- API endpoints.
- Database schema.
- Installation/setup guide for your project.
